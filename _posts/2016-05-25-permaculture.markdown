This Wednesday Maggie and I went to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Vancouver-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/231411830/">Permaculture meetup</a> at the Kits communtiy centre. 

She did graphic recording for the meeting:

We sat in the communtiy garden and discussed using available energy such as rain, sun and homegrown compost instead of turning on the tap or buying fertilizer. Basically keeping existing energy within the system instead of sending it out and then bringing in different energy as we typically do nowadays. 

We talked about how people have the right intentions and the desire to have sustainable lifestyles but there is a knowledge barrier to things such as growing your own food in an environmentally and economically friendly way.

For example, most of the gardening websites I read tell me to turn over my soil before planting, but tiling causes the soil to lose its carbon content and relseases carbon dioxide gas into the air. Obviously my 5 by 4 garden is not the cause of global climate change, but if everybody, and that means huge industrial farms, stopped tiling the ground then it probably would make a difference!

The important thing is that once you know what's up, you can make informed decisions. If everybody is responsible for their own carbon footprint and alters their small, everyday decisions to be more responsible, then we wouldn't have a problem. Set out buckets to catch rain water instead of turning on the tap. Throw weeds into your compost instead of sending them to a landfill.

Working in software companies has proven to me again and again the importance of modularity, in teams and in software. Teams are so much more efficient when they are small, focused, and indepedent. The same can be applied to people in society. Each person, or family, should be an independent module, sorting out their own recycling from garbage correctly so that there doesn't need to be wasted energy somewhere else to sort it a second time- what a waste of everybody's time and energy!

This isn't about being a tree-hugger environmentalist. Honestly, when I imagine an earth with no trees, no animals, and no humans, that's not a trajedy. It's just different, the world changes. What bugs me is the illogicality of the systems we have in place. Why would we send our bath water away from our house to be cleaned somewhere else when we could collect it and use it a second time, to water our gardens, and not need to transport it at all? I believe that the 3 E's- the economony, the environment and ethics- are closely intertwined, and the solution for a problem in one domain often helps with problems in another. It just makes sense.

Now I just need to practice what I preach. :p
