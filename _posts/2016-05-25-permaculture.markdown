This Wednesday Maggie and I went to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Vancouver-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/231411830/">Permaculture meetup</a> at the Kits communtiy centre. 

She did graphic recording for the meeting:

We sat in the communtiy garden and discussed using available energy such as rain, sun and homegrown compost instead of turning on the tap or buying fertilizer. Basically keeping existing energy within the system instead of sending it out and then bringing in different energy as we typically do in industry.

It seems like our host, Patrick, does a lot of work with gardens in the area so I'm looking forward to learning more from him at the next meeting!
