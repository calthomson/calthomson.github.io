Parker got a bike for his birthday so this Easter weekend we hit the road and biked Saturna Island!

Saturna Island is the most remote and undeveloped of the Southern Gulf Islands- it took  three hours and two ferries to get there on a Friday morning, the first from Tsawassen to Swartz Bay, and the second from Swartz Bay to Saturna. There’s a more direct route to the island in the evening, but then you’d need to do an overnight trip. The ferry for Swartz Bay left at 7AM and BC Ferries advised us to arrive a full hour before the ferry, to ensure we got on. According to P, I neglected to mention that we needed to wake up at 5AM in order to bike to the ferry terminal in time.. my bad.

Despite having only four hours of sleep and no caffeine, the ride to the terminal was fun! Most importantly, we beat Google Maps’ ETA. It was still dark out when we left but the sun started to come up as we got close to the terminal. Very beautiful! I don’t have any pictures- not brave enough to try to handle my phone on the thin shoulder beside the ferry traffic. The gate for cyclists wasn’t open yet so we biked over to the entry for on-foot passengers and bought our tickets there ($20 per person; ask for a thoroughfare voucher to Saturna).

I always feel excited when I’m up doing things that early, like I’m cheating at life because everyone else is asleep. I was so excited that I gracefully passed out immediately after we sat down on the ferry.
