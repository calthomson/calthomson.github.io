This Sunday I ran my first half marathon!

I signed up for this race all of 8 weeks ago, googled "last minute half marathon training plan", and proceeded to get totally hyped up and excited about the idea of <b>finally</b> running a half.

I've trained for multiple half marathons over the past four years, but have always ended up getting injured. As soon as I up my weekly mileage, I tend to get runner's knee. This time I was so careful not to over do it. As soon as I started feeling pain I would take a day or two off. I went to physio and actually followed their instructions, I focused on speed work, and got a lot of my miles by running on softer trails instead of the hard pavement.

2 weeks before the race, school got crazy, and I abandonned any training schedule completely. I started to feel nervous as the race approached. I felt like I was completely unprepared. On the day of, Parker woke up with me at 6am to go to the course. The environment was totally uncompetitive but I was still dreading the crush at the starting line.

I didn't need to worry, though. At the starting line I found my marker, a woman holding the 2:00 sign. I had wanted, at the beginning of my training, to do the race in under 2 hours. Even though, as my training progressed, I told myself that I shouldn't aim for any time on this first race, I secretly still hoped to get it.

The race started and I felt excellent. Running with so many people was exhilerating! I never run with other people. Running is my 'me' time, it's very meditative, so I don't want to talk to anyone. Running with a crowd, though, was different. I felt like we were all in it together and wanted each other to succeed. It was also interesting to see how different people managed the race: who started slow and built up speed in the middle, who's pace remained consistant... There were a couple people who stayed near me the whole race and I started to feel like we knew each other.

I finally tuned into what the Strava voice was telling me. I was running at 5:00 min/km for the first 3 kilometres. In order to run a half in under 2 hours, I knew I needed to run 5:39 min/km, so that's usually the pace that I trained at. I knew I needed to slow down, but the pace felt so good so I just went with it, I didn't feel like I was working hard. 

The 2 week taper before the race turned out to be a good thing for me. Any pains I had in my shins and feet from before were gone, and I was able to take full advantage of the downhill parts, letting my body go as fast as it wanted to without feeling any joint pain.
