Prickly branches scrape against my bare arms and make my skin itch. Everything is damp and the musty smell of wet moss and sickly-sweet decomposition s is all around me.

“That’s skunk cabbage!” My mother exclaims, clearly very pleased. She is too enthralled by her surroundings to notice that the string of children following in single formation behind her do not share her enchantment with this new and wondrous product of mother nature.

Above, the glaring, gray sky is barely visible between the spindly fingers of the pine trees that surround us. Mum leads, with me close behind. I walk on her heels, willing the gloom of my aura to somehow penetrate the effervescent bubble that surrounds her, born the moment we arrived at this place and growing ever larger and brighter with each passing skunk cabbage.

		My sister, Dulcie, walks behind me, humming tunelessly, her eyes glazed over. Our younger sister Wallis and brother August, follow. Each of them clutches a stuffed dog, Broccoli and Rhubarb. My dad walks a few paces in front of my mum, slashing gleefully at the brush with a long knife that he purchased from Canadian Tire this morning.

As I swat yet another mosquito away I think wistfully of the warm, dry pavement of the col-de-sac outside of 4 Holly Place. I miss the Eucalyptus trees and the rocks of the orange gravel pathways around our house. I even miss the ants, and the flies, I think wistfully, as I crush yet another mosquito into my palm.

I dreaded our trips to “The Land”. 24 acres of swampy, forested land, interrupted every now and then by a clearing, typically populated by a broken-down car, perhaps a rusty old washing machine, or some other discarded household appliance. How did our family end up here, in Middle of Nowhere, O Canada?

Our procession halts and I stop just short of bumping into the back of my mother. A wide, muddy puddle interrupts our path, and we must change our direction. We skirt along the edge of the shallow creek that trickles through the middle of the property, and find ourselves, finally, in an opening.

		Here, the light finally breaches the wall of green above, and I turn my face up to the warm fingers of the sun. My parents talk excitedly to each other, pointing around the small clearing, their eyes sparkling with delight. Dulcie stoops to examine the bunches of wildflowers that surge boldly from the wet ground. At the edge of a clearing is a gnarled old tree. I approach it and reach out to touch its knotted trunk.

“It’s an apple tree” My mother tells me, approaching from behind. I see my father behind her, stamping a long stick into the ground and tying an orange marker to it. “Next year, in the spring, it will have beautiful blossoms, and you will be able to smell them right from your bedroom window!” I gaze up the gnarled trunk, through the maze of twisted branches, and see that the clouds have lightened. A patch of blue slowly forms above. 

The next year, the day before my birthday, the beautiful pink-white buds unfold, and the air is full of their sweet smell- with only a hint of skunk cabbage. Their pollen in the sunlight, like fairy dust, makes the air glitter.

It was the first day of the dying months. A cold wind rolled along the air and Squirrel paused, listening to it. His nose twitched as he began to think about preparation for the Big Sleep. The sun, albeit weak through a sea of cloud, extended it’s warm fingers, and I opened myself towards them.<br>

Suddenly there arose a rustling, as the brush to the west sighed apart and six shadows passed into my glade. All larger than squirrel, and vaguely familiar, they were quite noisy and had their branches all in a tangle.<br>

The larger of the six slashed and hacked at the walls of my glade, sending branches and vines to the earth. Squirrel nestled high, at the very tips of my reach, and Bird fled on warm wind.<br>

That was the first day.

As the Big Sleep approached, the strangers returned each day. They cut away at my glade, with more speed, and bigger branches- but, no, those tools were not branches. Made of compressed earth, harder than a knotted wood, they rung out on struck stone and disrupted saplings like the wind a dandelion.<br>

One day, they came with hard, loud creatures, made from that compressed, shiny earth. The ground rumbled and churned under the rolling things, and my neighbors fell around me. The air was thick with the dust of bark, branch and needle. Roots trembled and shifted as the earth convulsed, but finally the creatures departed. Silence echoed as the clearing of naked soil settled.

		More time passed, and a peculiar structure rose up in the place of those who were torn down. The strangers regularly entered this place. They called it the “inside”. Away from the sun, and wind, and sweet rain, they would sit like Squirrel in his burrow. A small, dark space full of stale air where proximity would often incite conflict.<br><br>

		They were confusing, peculiar things, these Strangers. <br>

One day, one of them appeared from the “inside”. She had with her a tool of compressed earth, which she used to create a small hole in the earth. She knelt, placed something in this hole, and then covered it again. She returned to the “inside”.

Days passed, the wind warmed, and rain fell. A small green tendril appeared on the mound of dirt the stranger had created. With no competing roots to butt its tender head against, it sprung from the earth, its vibrant greenness on the churned dark, dirt as a star on the night sky. Bathed in sunlight, with no neighbors to shroud it in shadow, it unfurled and tentatively lifted upwards towards the sun’s warm embrace. A small green leaf unfolded from its side.
